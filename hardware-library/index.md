# Hardware Library

## Overview

The RRIV hardware library collects informations about various datalogger and sensor hardware that may be useful for specific environmental sensing use cases. TThird party sensors and other components may be easily integrated into the RRIV datalogger, and this library provides information to encourage that use. Documentation may also suggest particular sensor models, but these should not be interpreted as endorsements.

It is up to you to verify that any third party sensor or component will perform correctly for your specific deployment goals. Thus RRIV explicitly does not provide any warranty or guarentee for any third party hardware listed or suggested for use in our documentation.

Submissions to this hardware library are encouraged, and can be submitted as pull requests to this repository, located at https://github.com/rrivirr/rriv-documentation
