### Tools & Methodologies

RRIV is a multidisciplinary team collaborating on a pretty big undertaking and that means each of us gets to solve fun and interesting challenges.
To do this, we try to establish a clear path to staying engaged in the most motivating and fullfilling aspects of the work.
We encourage each other to build a High Ergonomic Integrity - with toolsets and working methods that empower more focused, creative, and hassle-free workflows.
Here you will find tools & methodologies that we have found to make the highest impact on their own and especially when used together.
