# Proton Pass

**Prerequisites**: a rriv.org email account (ask [Zaven Arra](https://app.gitbook.com/u/aq6UZ6kvD3goApKnPpuXdUNw3Yz1 "mention") for one)

1. Create an account with Proton: [https://account.proton.me/login](https://account.proton.me/login) **using your rriv.org email.**
2. Download the Proton Pass browser extension app and pin it to your browser taskbar: [https://proton.me/pass/download](https://proton.me/pass/download) When you need to retrieve a password, click the purple diamond icon to open it: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)
3. Request [Zaven Arra](https://app.gitbook.com/u/aq6UZ6kvD3goApKnPpuXdUNw3Yz1 "mention")or [kat](https://app.gitbook.com/u/bjxPMRj3gNX5ozckPu0XZzqngd72 "mention")to add you to the RRIV Proton organization. From here, you will have access to a shared Member vault. This vault contains shared credentials for all team members to use.
4. For personal logins to accounts that you create via your rriv.org email, you should store them in your Personal vault.
5. For sending sensitive data (passwords or otherwise), that are either ephemeral, or you are trying to share with a non-member contributor, use the Secure Link share option. Restrict sharing to only a single view. We want to encourage sensitive data to stay in Proton Pass and not be copied externally.\
