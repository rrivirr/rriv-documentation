## Project Tools

There are two classes of users

* directors?
* member
  * Members get @rriv.org addresses
* contributor
  * Contributors use their free proton account addresses
  * ( or their own personal email addresses (with less access to stuff) )

Calendar, drive, docs, and password manager shall all be handled via Proton services.\
Users without paid accounts shall create a free proton accoun to access Proton services.\
The main calendar will be the RRIV proton calendar

If organizational email filtering becomes desirable, we can use filtering functionality in Proton for Organizations\

Chat and video conferencing shall be handled via Matrix (element, jitsi)

Our IDP shall be keycloack running in our own cluster
